Bookmarklet: Typogr
===================
This is a bookmarklet that uses components of [Typogr](https://github.com/ekalinin/typogr.js) to typographically enhance sites. All the actual work is done by functions copied straight from Typogr, so I suggest [checking it out](https://github.com/ekalinin/typogr.js)&mdash;it's great.

The functions were extracted into the bookmarklet to not have to load
the two script files (jQuery and Typogr) when running it, and because
we only need these specific goodies.

Usage

Create a new bookmark with the following URL (I can't give you a drag-and-droppable link, because GitHub does not allow JavaScript links):

```
